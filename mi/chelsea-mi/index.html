            <h3>Chelsea, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The area was first settled as early as 1820 within the Michigan Territory by settler Cyrus Beckwith. It would be organized as Sylvan Township in 1834. The Michigan Central Railroad constructed a line through the area in 1848, and a post office was first established on January 4, 1849. It was originally named Kendon. The name was changed to Chelsea on July 19, 1850 when the train station opened and community was formally platted. The name Chelsea came from Elisha Congdon, who suggested the name after his hometown of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Chelsea incorporated as a village in 1889. The Chelsea courthouse is housed in a 120-year-old bank building in downtown.</p>
