                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Chattahoochee Hills (formerly Chattahoochee Hill Country) is a city in southern Fulton County, Georgia, United States. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 2,378 living in an area of just over 32,000 acres (130 km2). The population in 2019 was estimated to 3,318 in an area of approximately 37,473 acres (151.65 km2) acres after subsequent annexations. It is the incorporated part of a region called 'Chattahoochee Hill Country', an area encompassing approximately 60,000 acres (240 km2) southwest of Atlanta, bordered on the northwest side by the Chattahoochee River. Unlike the rest of metro Atlanta, it is still relatively undeveloped, and most of its rural character remains unchanged. The majority of the wider area comprises the west-southwest part of southern Fulton, and smaller adjacent parts of southern Douglas, eastern Carroll, and northern Coweta counties.</p>
