                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Portland (/ˈpɔːrtlənd/ PORT-lənd) is a port city and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maine and the seat of Cumberland County. Portland's population was 68,408 in April 2020. The Greater Portland metropolitan area is home to over half a million people, the 104th-largest metropolitan area in the United States.

Despite the economic shift, the Port of Portland was still the second-largest tonnage seaport in New England as of 2019.</p>
